WebEdit v.1.3.2 - freeware open-source plugin for Notepad++.

This plugin allows you to define up to 30 commands. Each command will surround
the currently selected text with the Left and Right text defined for the
command. If there is no selection, the Left text is inserted to the left of
current caret position, and the Right text is inserted to the right. In any
case the selection and relative cursor position are preserved. Clipboard is
not used. Both text insertions can be undone/redone as a single action.

The commands are to be defined in WebEdit.ini file, in the "[Commands]"
section. Ini-file format:
- a character with code below 32 (space) terminates a line (i.e. end-of-line
  sequence does not matter), the only exception is the tab character;
- line length must not exceed 1022 characters (if a longer line is encountered,
  file processing is aborted at that point);
- any line starting with a semicolon character (;) is considered a comment and
  ignored;
- the file may contain any number of any sections. A section is a line of the
  following format: "[" <section name> "]". Only the sections with supported
  names are processed in order of appearance, all others are ignored.

The "[Commands]" section format:
- if you want a line to contain a non-printable character, you must escape it
  with a backslash; the following escape sequences are supported:
  - \t = 09 - tab character;
  - \n = 10 - line feed (LF) character;
  - \r = 13 - carriage return (CR) character;
  - \\ = "\" - double backslash is replaced with a single backslash. This is
    required if you don't want "\t", "\n", etc. to be escaped: just write
    "\\t" and you will get "\t";
  - any other characters after the backslash are not escaped, e.g. "\a" = "\a";
- the minimum valid line is "=|" any line not containing "=" and "|" after it
  is ignored;
- line syntax: [menu item] "=" [Left text] "|" [Right text], for example:
  "Paragraph=<p>|</p>";
- syntax explanation:
  - [menu item] is the text displayed in the plugin menu ("Paragraph"));
  - [Left text] is the text inserted to the left of current selection ("<p>");
  - [Right text] is the text inserted to the right of current selection ("</p>");
  - all of the above strings are optional;
  - limitations: you can't use "=" in the menu text, and you can't use "|" in
    the Left text.
At most 30 commands may be defined in the "[Commands]" section, all superfluous
commands are ignored. The defined commands are listed in the plugin menu in the
order they appear in the file. Unused menu slots appear as disabled and show
text "WebEdit Slot XX", where XX is the number of the slot. The first slot is
numbered "01".

The "[Toolbar]" section determines which of the command slots will be placed on
the toolbar. Syntax: <slot number> "=" <file name>
Example: 1=Paragraph.bmp
Slot numbers are 1..30. The file should be placed in the plugins/Config folder
and should contain a bitmap image suitable for the toolbar.

The configuration file is looked for in the standard plugin configuration
folder of the Notepad++ (if Notepad++ is installed in portable mode, the folder
is "Notepad++\plugins\Config"). You may edit the file and update the plugin
configuration without restarting Notepad++ by selecting the "Load Config"
command from the plugin menu. (Note, the toolbar is only updated on Notepad++
startup.)

You may assign shortcuts to the plugin menu items via Settings - Shortcut
Mapper - Plugin commands. If you are running Notepad++ 5.0 and later, you will
see the actual command names, i.e. instead of the dummy text "WebEdit Slot XX"
you will see "WebEdit - Command name", where the "Command name" is the text as
displayed in the plugin menu. Due to insufficient support of the dynamic menus
by Notepad++ the text in the Shortcut Mapper will only be updated on restart.

Hint: if you want to set a menu accelerator, use ampersand character (&) in the
menu item text. For example: "&Paragraph tag=<p>|</p>". The character after the
ampersand ("P" in this case) will be underlined in the plugin menu, which makes
it possible to simply type "p" on the keyboard instead of selecting the menu
item with mouse or cursor keys. The accelerator, of course, will only work when
the plugin menu is displayed (press "Alt+p, w" to display the "Plugins -
WebEdit" menu).

Installation note. To use this plugin you have to copy the WebEdit.ini file
into Notepad++\plugins\Config folder (it may be either in "Program Files" or in
"Application Data" of your current user, depending on whether you installed
Notepad++ in the Portable mode or not). If the file is absent you will see that
the plugin menu consists entirely of grayed items.

PS: If you feel that the limit of 30 functions maximum is too constricting, you
may painlessly increase the number up to 99, but you will have to recompile the
plugin. See instructions in the WebEdit.ob2 source file.
