WebEdit changelog.

Version 1.2. 18 Jun 2008.
- Notepad++ 5.0 and later only: the Shortcut Mapper will show actual menu
  item names instead of dummy "WebEdit XX", e.g. "WebEdit - Paragraph Tag".
  Note: to update strings displayed by the Shortcut Mapper you have to restart
  Notepad++. If you have used "Load Config" to update the plugin configuration,
  the shortcut table may be out of date.

Version 1.1. 07 Jun 2008.
- The dummy menu entries are renamed from "not used" to "WebEdit Slot XX", where
  XX is the number of the slot. This helps greatly to find the items in the Shortcut
  Mapper and differentiate between them.
- The double slash is now recognized as an escape sequence in the ini-file.
- Added version information resource to the DLL.

Version 1.0. 18 Mar 2008.
- Plugin renamed to WebEdit (was NppWebEdit) to simplify navigation in the "Plugins" menu.
- Added WebEdit.txt file with the plugin description.
- The plugin now has 15 menu slots for user-defined functions read from WebEdit.ini.

Version 0.2. 08 Mar 2008.
- Insertion of a pair of tags is undone as a single action.

Version 0.1. 06 Mar 2008.
