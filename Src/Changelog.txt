Version 1.2. 18 Jun 2008.
- New feature for Notepad++ 5.0 and later: the Shortcut Mapper will show the
  actual menu item names instead of dummy "WebEdit XX", e.g. "WebEdit -
  Paragraph Tag".
  Note: to update strings displayed by the Shortcut Mapper you have to restart
  Notepad++. If you have used "Load Config" to update the plugin configuration,
  the shortcut table may be out of date.
